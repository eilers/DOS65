One key concept in DOS/65 is that of the transient execution area (TEA). TEA is the start of the RAM area in which the user can execute programs. It is fixed for a given configuration although alternative addresses are available as driven by the users hardware and software configuration.

The most common TEA start is $200. This value is valid for OSI, SBC2, W65C02SXB, S-100, and most other general-purpose single board computers.

The one alternative TEA start that is currently supported is $800. This value is valid for Commodore 64 and similar computers.

If an address other than one of these two values is desired it requires special effort on my part to generate the executables. It can be done but I hope potential users recognize that as an unusual circumstance.

Accordingly the releases are organized into two distinct groups. The first is for TEA $200 and the second is for TEA $800. Choose which you wish to use for your situation and ensure that you download only source code, object code, and binaries for that group.

All files presented in the web site are for TEA $200 except for those presented in the C64 page.
